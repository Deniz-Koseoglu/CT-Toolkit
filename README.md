# CT-Toolkit
This Classification Tree (CT) and running correlation toolkit was created in R Studio (version 3.4.2) as a supplement to the following publication: 

D. Köseoğlu, S.T. Belt, K. Husum, and J. Knies (2018), "An assessment of biomarker-based multivariate classification methods versus the PIP<sub>25</sub> index for paleo Arctic sea ice reconstruction" (manuscript submitted to the <i>Organic Geochemistry</i> journal).

The toolkit is provided as-is under the terms of the MIT licence (see LICENCE.md in the repository root).
